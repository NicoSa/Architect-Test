==============
This was a test for the weekend from Makers Academy.

Objectives of exercise

Using Test-Driven-Development to create an Airport simulation. With Airplanes that can takeoff and land and an Airport that only has a certain capacity. There was also supposed to be random weather that can deny Airplanes from taking off and landing.

Technologies used
----
- Ruby
- Rspec
- Git

How to run it
----
```sh
git clone git@github.com:NicoSa/Architect-Test.git
cd Architect-Test
irb
```
- You can play with the classes, create new planes, see what the weather is like. I also included a Supernatural module. Find out what it does by yourself!
